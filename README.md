# smg

`smg` turns a codebase into a queryable graph of modules, classes, functions, and their relationships. Agents use it to understand architecture before writing code. Humans use it to generate diagrams and explore dependencies.

## Supported languages

| Language | Extensions | Grammar |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Python | `.py` | `tree-sitter-python` |
| JavaScript | `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` | `tree-sitter-javascript` |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx` | `tree-sitter-typescript` |
| C/C++ | `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.hpp`, `.hh`, `.hxx` | `tree-sitter-c` |
| CUDA | `.cu`, `.cuh` | `tree-sitter-c` (C++ parser) |
| Zig | `.zig` | `tree-sitter-zig` |

All languages extract: classes/structs, functions, methods, constants, containment, imports, inheritance, call graph, and per-function metrics. Adding a language means writing a `langs/<language>.py` extractor and a `BranchMap` — the metrics engine and scanner are shared.

## How it works

`smg` stores a graph of code entities in `.smg/graph.jsonl` at your project root. Each line is a node (module, class, function, ...) or a typed edge (contains, calls, imports, inherits, ...).

There are three ways to populate the graph:

1. **`smg scan`** — tree-sitter parses source files and extracts symbols, containment, imports, inheritance, and call graph automatically.
2. **Manual CLI** — agents or humans add nodes and edges directly with `smg add` and `smg link`.
3. **Both** — scan for the baseline, then layer on domain-specific relationships (e.g. "tests", "endpoint", custom types).

### Provenance tracking

Every node and edge is tagged with `source: "scan"` or `source: "manual"`. When rescanning, only scan-sourced nodes are cleaned — manual annotations survive. If a rescan deletes a node that had manual edges, those orphaned edges are reported so the agent can re-link them.

### Excluding files

`smg scan` skips common non-source directories by default (`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, etc.). You can extend this in two ways:

- **`--exclude` flag** — pass additional glob patterns per invocation: `smg scan src/ --exclude "*.generated.py" --exclude "vendor/*"`
- **`.smgignore` file** — place a `.smgignore` at your project root with one glob pattern per line (same syntax as `.gitignore`). These patterns are loaded automatically on every scan.

### Auto-format detection

When stdout is a **terminal**, output is rich text with colors and tables. When stdout is **piped** (i.e. an agent is reading it), output is JSON. No flags needed.

```bash
# Human sees a rich panel
smg about auth.service

# Agent gets structured JSON
result=$(smg about auth.service)
```

You can always override with `--format text` or `--format json`.

## Agent usage

Agents should treat `smg` as a codebase database. The typical workflow:

### 1. Orient

```bash
smg overview                    # Graph stats, top connected nodes, module sizes
smg about auth.service          # Context card: type, file, connections, containment path
```

### 2. Investigate

```bash
smg impact auth.service         # What depends on this? (reverse transitive)
smg between api.routes db.models  # How do these connect?
smg diff                        # What changed structurally since last commit?
smg analyze                     # Cycles, dead code, hotspots, code smells
smg analyze --summary --top 5   # Key findings only
smg query deps auth.service     # What does this depend on? (forward transitive)
```

### 3. Enforce

```bash
smg rule add layering --deny "infra.* -> app.*"
smg rule add acyclic --invariant no-cycles
smg rule add reachable --invariant no-dead-code --entry-points "main,cli.*"
smg check                       # check all rules (exit 1 on violation)
smg check layering              # check a specific rule
```

### 4. Inspect

```bash
smg show auth.service           # Node details + direct edges + metrics
smg query outgoing auth.service --rel calls  # What does it call?
smg query incoming auth.service --rel calls  # What calls it?
smg list --type class           # All classes in the graph
```

### 5. Mutate

```bash
smg add endpoint /api/login --doc "Login endpoint" --meta method=POST
smg link api.routes calls auth.service
smg scan src/ --clean           # Rescan (smart clean preserves manual edges)
smg scan --changed              # Incremental: only files changed since HEAD
smg scan --since HEAD~3         # Incremental: since a specific ref
smg watch src/                  # Auto-rescan on file changes (background)
```

### 6. Batch operations

```bash
echo '{"op":"add","type":"module","name":"app"}
{"op":"add","type":"function","name":"app.main"}
{"op":"link","source":"app","rel":"contains","target":"app.main"}' | smg batch
```

One graph load/save cycle for all mutations. Partial failure tolerant — errors on individual lines are reported but don't stop processing.

### 7. Export

```bash
smg export mermaid              # Paste into docs
smg export dot | dot -Tpng -o graph.png  # Render with Graphviz
smg export json --indent        # Full graph as JSON
```

## Per-function metrics

Every function and method node includes AST-based metrics in its metadata, computed automatically during scan:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cyclomatic_complexity` | Number of linearly independent paths through a function. 1 + branches + boolean operators. [McCabe (1976)][mccabe] |
| `cognitive_complexity` | Branches weighted by nesting depth — penalizes deeply nested logic more than flat branching. [Campbell (2018)][cognitive] |
| `max_nesting_depth` | Deepest control flow nesting level |
| `lines_of_code` | Function body line count |
| `parameter_count` | Number of parameters |
| `return_count` | Number of return statements |
| `fan_in` | How many functions call this one |
| `fan_out` | How many functions this one calls |

Language-agnostic — metrics are computed from tree-sitter ASTs using a per-language `BranchMap` that maps node types to semantic roles.

```bash
# Top 5 most complex functions
smg list --type function --format json | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for n in sorted(json.load(sys.stdin),
    key=lambda x: x.get('metadata',{}).get('metrics',{}).get('cyclomatic_complexity',0),
    reverse=True)[:5]:
    m = n['metadata']['metrics']
    print(f'{m[\"cyclomatic_complexity\"]:3d} CC  {n[\"name\"]}')"
```

## Architectural analysis

`smg analyze` runs graph-theoretic, OO, and smell-detection analyses in a single pass.

```bash
smg analyze                        # all analyses
smg analyze --module auth          # scope to auth.* nodes
smg analyze --summary --top 5      # hotspots and key findings only
smg analyze --format json          # structured output for agents
```

### Graph-theoretic analyses

| Analysis | What it finds | Why it matters |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Cycle detection | Circular dependencies between modules/classes. Uses Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components. [Tarjan (1972)][tarjan] | Cycles prevent independent deployment and testing — they force you to change and release coupled components together. |
| Topological layering | Assigns each node a layer based on dependency depth (layer 0 = leaves with no outgoing deps). | Reveals the architecture's depth. Tall, narrow layer stacks suggest long dependency chains; wide layers suggest parallel modules. |
| PageRank | Ranks nodes by recursive importance — a node is important if important nodes depend on it. [Brin & Page (1998)][pagerank] | Identifies load-bearing abstractions: the modules that, if broken, cascade failures through the most dependents. |
| Betweenness centrality | Measures how often a node lies on shortest paths between other nodes. [Brandes (2001)][brandes] | Nodes with high betweenness are structural bottlenecks — information and control flow must pass through them. Changing them has outsized risk. |
| k-core decomposition | Finds the maximal subgraph where every node has at least _k_ connections. [Seidman (1983)][seidman] | The innermost core is the tightly coupled heart of the architecture. If it's large, the system may be hard to decompose. |
| Bridge detection | Edges whose removal disconnects part of the graph. | Bridges are fragile — they represent sole paths between components. Redundant paths (no bridges) indicate a more resilient architecture. |
| Fan-in / fan-out | Per-node counts of incoming (fan-in) and outgoing (fan-out) coupling edges. | High fan-in means a node is heavily depended on (risky to change). High fan-out means a node depends on many others (sensitive to their changes). |
| Dead code detection | Nodes with zero incoming coupling edges (no callers, no importers), excluding modules, packages, and known entry points. | Dead code inflates the codebase without providing value. Removing it reduces maintenance burden and cognitive load. |
| Layering violations | Coupling edges where the source is at the same or lower topological layer than the target — back-dependencies. | These are the specific edges that create cycles or violate the intended dependency flow. They tell you which edges to remove to restore clean layering. |

### OO metrics

The CK suite ([Chidamber & Kemerer, 1994][ck]) and Martin's package metrics ([Martin, 1994][martin]) quantify class-level and module-level design quality.

| Metric | Per | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| WMC | class | Weighted Methods per Class — sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods. High WMC indicates a class that does too much. |
| DIT | class | Depth of Inheritance Tree — how many ancestors a class has. Deep trees increase complexity and fragility. |
| NOC | class | Number of Children — direct subclass count. Many children suggest a class is a key abstraction (or overused as a base). |
| CBO | class | Coupling Between Objects — number of distinct external classes this class couples to. High CBO makes classes hard to reuse and test. |
| RFC | class | Response For a Class — methods in the class plus distinct methods they directly call. High RFC means more potential behavior to test. |
| LCOM4 | class | Lack of Cohesion of Methods — number of connected components in the intra-class method call graph. LCOM4 > 1 means the class has disjoint responsibilities and should likely be split. [Hitz & Montazeri (1995)][lcom4] |
| Ca / Ce | module | Afferent (incoming) / efferent (outgoing) coupling — how many other modules depend on this one, and how many it depends on. |
| Instability | module | Ce / (Ca + Ce). Ranges from 0 (stable, heavily depended upon) to 1 (unstable, depends on others). |
| Abstractness | module | Ratio of interfaces to total classes. Ranges from 0 (all concrete) to 1 (all abstract). |
| Distance | module | \|A + I - 1\| — distance from the "main sequence" line where A + I = 1. Modules far from this line are either too abstract for their stability or too concrete for their instability. |
| SDP violations | module | Cases where a stable module depends on an unstable module, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Dependencies should flow toward stability. |

### Code smells

These patterns, cataloged by [Fowler (1999)][fowler], indicate structural problems that make code harder to change.

| Smell | Detection rule | What it means |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| God Class | WMC >= 20 AND CBO >= 5 AND LCOM4 >= 2 | A class with too many responsibilities — complex, coupled, and incohesive. Should be split. |
| Feature Envy | Method references another class's members more than its own (>= 2 external refs) | The method probably belongs in the other class. Moving it improves cohesion in both classes. |
| Shotgun Surgery | Function/method with coupling fan-out >= 7 | Changing this function likely requires coordinated changes across many dependents. Reducing fan-out isolates change. |

All analyses feed into a synthesized **hotspot ranking** that scores nodes by a weighted combination of complexity, coupling, cohesion, centrality, and importance, surfacing the areas most likely to cause problems.

## Architectural constraints

`smg analyze` tells you what *is* true about your architecture. `smg rule` and `smg check` let you declare what *should* be true — and find where the code departs from intent.

This is inspired by Alloy's approach to software design ([Jackson, 2012][alloy]): state structural properties declaratively, then check them automatically. When a rule is violated, smg reports the specific offending edges or nodes — concrete counterexamples, not just "violated: true."

### Path denial rules

Forbid coupling edges that match a glob pattern:

```bash
# No module in infra/ may depend on app/
smg rule add layering --deny "infra.* -> app.*"

# Controllers must not directly call repository code
smg rule add no-direct-db --deny "*.controller -[calls]-> *.repository"
```

Patterns use `fnmatch` syntax over fully-qualified node names. The optional `[rel]` filter restricts to a specific relationship type; without it, all coupling edges (calls, imports, inherits, implements, depends_on) are checked.

### Structural invariants

Bind existing analyses to named, persistent rules:

```bash
smg rule add acyclic --invariant no-cycles
smg rule add reachable --invariant no-dead-code --entry-points "main,cli.*"
smg rule add layered --invariant no-layering-violations
```

| Invariant | What it checks |
|-----------|---------------|
| `no-cycles` | No circular dependencies (Tarjan's SCC) |
| `no-dead-code` | Every non-entry node has at least one incoming coupling edge |
| `no-layering-violations` | No back-dependency edges violate topological layering |

### Checking rules

```bash
smg check                  # check all rules
smg check layering         # check one rule
smg check --format json    # structured output for agents / CI
```

Exit code 0 means all rules pass; exit code 1 means at least one violation. This makes `smg check` suitable as a CI gate:

```bash
smg scan src/ --clean && smg check
```

Rules are stored in `.smg/rules` (JSONL, same format as the graph) and persist across sessions.

## Node types

`package`, `module`, `class`, `function`, `method`, `interface`, `variable`, `constant`, `type`, `endpoint`, `config` — plus any custom string.

## Relationship types

`calls`, `inherits`, `implements`, `contains`, `depends_on`, `imports`, `returns`, `accepts`, `overrides`, `decorates`, `tests` — plus any custom string.

## Data format

`.smg/graph.jsonl` — one JSON object per line:

```jsonl
{"kind":"node","name":"app.core.Engine","type":"class","file":"src/app/core.py","line":12,"docstring":"The engine.","metadata":{"source":"scan","metrics":{...}}}
{"kind":"edge","source":"app.core","rel":"contains","target":"app.core.Engine","metadata":{"source":"scan"}}
```

Git-friendly, human-readable, parseable with zero tooling. Nodes sorted by name, edges by (source, rel, target). Written atomically via temp file + rename.

## Name resolution

Node names are fully qualified (`app.core.Engine.run`), but you can use short names:

```bash
smg about Engine          # Matches app.core.Engine if unambiguous
smg show run              # Error if multiple matches — lists candidates
```

## Design principles

- **Agent-first**: JSON by default when piped, structured output, exit codes for branching
- **Gradual disclosure**: `about` → `show` → `query` — start simple, drill down as needed
- **Language-agnostic**: tree-sitter grammars for any language, BranchMap protocol for metrics
- **Incremental**: `--changed` rescans only modified files, `watch` for live updates
- **Provenance-aware**: scan vs manual annotations tracked, manual edges survive rescans
- **Zero config**: `smg init && smg scan .` works on any supported project
- **Git-friendly**: JSONL is diffable, sorted deterministically, written atomically
